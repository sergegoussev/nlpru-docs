Welcome to nlpru-docs's documentation!
======================================

**nlpru** is a library meant to simplify Natural Language Processing and analysis of Russian text. It is built with Russian language social media data in mind, specifically *Twitter*.

**nlpru** makes it easy to use several methods commonly used with *natural language processsing*, such as categorizing tweets by topic, preprocessing (or cleaning text), etc. While several other libraries exist that can do many of these things, general libraries ones such as [**preprocessor**](https://github.com/s/preprocessor) don't seem to work well with Russian text. Russian specific libraries, such as [**pymorphy2**](https://github.com/kmike/pymorphy2) (which **nlpru** uses behind the scenes) offer useful NLP morphological analysis but not preprocessing or facilitation of different types of analysis.
